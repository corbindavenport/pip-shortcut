# Picture-in-Picture Shortcut

Picture-in-Picture Shortcut adds a keyboard shortcut and toolbar button for switching video players to the [Picture-in-Picture mode](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture) in web browsers. The default keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl+Period` (`Command+Period` on Mac), but it can be changed from the browser settings. The Picture-in-Picture Shortcut extension button in the browser's toolbar can be used to toggle PiP mode.

Google Chrome and other Chromium browsers have a built-in Picture-in-Picture button in the default media controls, but it isn't always available and requires multiple mouse clicks. Picture-in-Picture Shortcut also overrides sites that [don't normally allow Picture-in-Picture mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/disablePictureInPicture), and attempts to add a play/pause button to the PiP popup. However, this may not always work for sites and players not originally built for PiP mode.
