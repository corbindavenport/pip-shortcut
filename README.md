# Picture-in-Picture Shortcut

Picture-in-Picture Shortcut adds a keyboard shortcut for switching video players to the [Picture-in-Picture mode in modern web browsers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture). Chrome has a built-in Picture-in-Picture button in the media controls, but isn't always available and requires multiple mouse clicks.

The default shortcut is `Ctrl+Period`, but it can be changed from the browser settings. Clicking the Picture-in-Picture Shortcut extension button works, too.

Picture-in-Picture Shortcut overrides sites that don't normally allow Picture-in-Picture mode, and attempts to add a play/pause button to the PiP popup. However, this may not always work for sites and players not originally built for PiP mode.
